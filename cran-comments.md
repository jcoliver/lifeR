# Resubmission
This is an update. In this version I have:

* Updated default values of a parameter to avoid unanticipated behavior of 
  pattern matching

# R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ‘knitr’
    All declared Imports should be used.

The knitr package is used to build vignettes.

# Downstream dependencies

There are no downstream dependencies.
